Project Requirements

The Night Owl Online Book Hub

The NightOwl Corp. wants to build an online book hub for
selecting, recommending, managing and reading books. They want
to list the books with a suitable cover image, title,
category, author name, a basic description, and the rating
received from the readers. The initial listing of the books
should be sorted based on the date they were added to the
backend system. However, the user will be able to sort them
based on user ratings.

As they expect the number of books in the book hub to grow in
the future, it would be helpful to have a search option to
search any book using its title. It would be great to have a
filtering option to filter the books based on category,
author.

Each book should be linked to a details page where the users
can know more about the books. We should also provide a link
on the details page to link to the content of the book.
The NightOwl Corp. wants their back-office team to
create/update/delete the books from the same website. Hence
the ability to perform these operations is highly desirable.

The NightOwl Corp. is willing to provide a dashboard to see
high-level information like,
- How many books are in each category?
- Top 10 Rated books
- Top 5 books by authors

Please note: Creating an authentication-authorization system
such that we know if a back-office team member or a regular
user has logged in is nice to have (a stretch goal). If you
attempt to build it, the Create/Update/Delete operations are
only allowed by the NightOwl Corp. back-office team members.
